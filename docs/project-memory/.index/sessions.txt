Title: Initial RAG service build — project scaffolding and full implementation
Date: 2026-02-18
Author: Claude + David

## Goal

Build the complete RAG service from the design doc: FastAPI server with document ingestion, vector search, drag-and-drop UI, and Docker packaging.

## Context

New standalone project for voice assistant RAG retrieval. Design doc approved at `docs/plans/2026-02-17-rag-service-design.md`. Traceable project memory system integrated from template repo.

## Plan

1. Set up project scaffolding (config, models, CLAUDE.md, project memory)
2. Implement core modules: embedder, vector store, parsers, chunker
3. Wire up document pipeline
4. Build FastAPI app with all routes
5. Create drag-and-drop web UI
6. Add Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
7. Test end-to-end

## Changes Made

- Initialized git repo
- Set up project memory system (sessions, ADRs, backlog, scripts, hooks)
- Created design doc at `docs/plans/2026-02-17-rag-service-design.md`
- Created CLAUDE.md with project overview + memory system rules

## Decisions Made

- Use latest dependency versions (Feb 2026) instead of spec's mid-2024 versions, pinned for reproducibility
- Integrated traceable-searchable-adr-memory-index system for session/decision tracking

## Open Questions

- LanceDB 0.29.2 API compatibility — may need minor adaptations from spec
- sentence-transformers 5.2.3 API — verify batch embedding interface
